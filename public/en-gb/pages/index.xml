      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a beginner, what&amp;rsquo;s the best keyboard for me to start with? We recommend starting with 60% layout: K:03, HPD, Planeta.
You have different switches and keycaps to choose from, which is the best one for me to choose? The most common option is Brown switches (tactile) and XDA keycaps.
I need a low profile keyboard, do you have one? You can choose all of our keyboards with mid-profile switches and low-profile keycaps, the mid-profile switches are slightly taller than the low-profile ones, but still have a standard MX connector, making them interchangeable with standard switches, and you most likely won&amp;rsquo;t notice the difference in height.</description>

      <description>RuEn mode This mode is designed to
place punctuation marks in the same places for Russian and English languages, enter characters from the English layout when printing in Russian, switch the layout to English or Russian using separate keys. This works due to the fact that the keyboard remembers the current layout, and if you need to enter a character that is not in the Russian layout, it automatically switches the layout, and after entering the character, it returns the layout back.</description>
