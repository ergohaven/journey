      <description>Preface The trackball itself, although it performs the same function of cursor control as a mouse, but the experience of using these two devices is completely different, and they are suitable for completely different tasks
Ergohaven Trackball Mini
The main advantages of a trackball over a mouse compactness - it will take up much less space on the table than a mouse, and even more so, such a small one, which was developed by the Ergohaven team; ergonomics - the position of the hand while spinning the ball, there is less strain on the wrist, and in general the control itself with the fingers seems more natural than the way we work with the mouse; The only downside I can note is that it is more difficult to accurately move the trackball over a long distance; in this case, I most often spin the ball with force, sending it floating freely, and here the predictability of where the cursor will stop is poor, so I have to move the cursor further.</description>

      <description>Intro It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that our store sells keycaps without symbols, some customers are stunned and decide to get the standard keycaps with symbols elsewhere.
In this article, you will find out what is touch typing and why you should consider to switch to blank keycaps.
What is touch typing? Description from Wikipedia:
Touch typing (also called blind typing, or touch keyboarding) is a style of typing. Although the phrase refers to typing without using the sense of sight to find the keys—specifically, a touch typist will know their location on the keyboard through muscle memory—the term is often used to refer to a specific form of touch typing that involves placing the eight fingers in a horizontal row along the middle of the keyboard (the home row) and having them reach for specific other keys.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a beginner, what&amp;rsquo;s the best keyboard for me to start with? We recommend starting with 60% layout: K:03, HPD, Planeta.
You have different switches and keycaps to choose from, which is the best one for me to choose? The most common option is Brown switches (tactile) and XDA keycaps.
I need a low profile keyboard, do you have one? You can choose all of our keyboards with mid-profile switches and low-profile keycaps, the mid-profile switches are slightly taller than the low-profile ones, but still have a standard MX connector, making them interchangeable with standard switches, and you most likely won&amp;rsquo;t notice the difference in height.</description>

      <description>RuEn mode This mode is designed to
place punctuation marks in the same places for Russian and English languages, enter characters from the English layout when printing in Russian, switch the layout to English or Russian using separate keys. This works due to the fact that the keyboard remembers the current layout, and if you need to enter a character that is not in the Russian layout, it automatically switches the layout, and after entering the character, it returns the layout back.</description>
