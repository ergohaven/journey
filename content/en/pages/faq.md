## I'm a beginner, what's the best keyboard for me to start with?
We recommend starting with 60% layout: K:03, HPD, Planeta.

## You have different switches and keycaps to choose from, which is the best one for me to choose?
The most common option is Brown switches (tactile) and XDA keycaps.

## I need a low profile keyboard, do you have one?
You can choose all of our keyboards with mid-profile switches and low-profile keycaps, the mid-profile switches are slightly taller than the low-profile ones, but still have a standard MX connector, making them interchangeable with standard switches, and you most likely won't notice the difference in height.

## And what switches and keycaps are suitable for your keyboards if I want to purchase them elsewhere?
Our keyboards are compatible with any switches that have MX legs/base; accordingly, keycaps must also have an MX connector.

## When choosing switches, there are 5 pin or 3 pin options, which should I choose?
Both will fit.
The only difference is that 5-pin switches has an additional pair of plastic legs for more support on pcb, but this doesn't matter that much for our keyboards since case will snuggle switches anyway.

## How do I customize my keyboard? How to reassign keys?
Detailed information on setting up keyboard is in [documentation](docs).

## Can you make me a custom keyboard in a different color, different shape, etc.
No, we do not deal with such orders.
